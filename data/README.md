# Data Taxonomy Rationale

This taxonomy is designed to support nationwide replacement property identification for 1031 exchange clients in San Antonio, Texas and surrounding areas. The structure prioritizes comprehensive coverage of exchange services, local market locations, and property types suitable for 1031 exchanges.

## Services Taxonomy (22 services)

Services are organized into seven categories: Timelines (4 services covering forward, reverse, simultaneous, and delayed exchanges), Structures (4 services for TIC, DST, build-to-suit, and improvement exchanges), Execution (2 services for qualified intermediary and coordination), Property Paths (2 services for property identification and search), Tax (3 services for like-kind verification, boot calculation, and tax deferral analysis), Reporting (3 services for Form 8824, documentation, and compliance), and Education (3 services for investor education, CPA coordination, and consultation).

This structure ensures clients can find services matching their specific exchange timeline, preferred ownership structure, execution needs, property search requirements, tax considerations, reporting obligations, and educational needs. Each service is designed to support nationwide property identification while maintaining compliance with IRS regulations.

## Locations Taxonomy (35 locations)

Locations include San Antonio proper with its major districts and neighborhoods, surrounding suburbs within 30-45 miles, and a remote option for nationwide property identification. The mix includes established neighborhoods like Alamo Heights and Stone Oak, commercial districts like Medical Center and Downtown, newer developments like The Rim and La Cantera, and surrounding cities like Boerne, Schertz, and New Braunfels.

This geographic diversity supports clients who may be exchanging properties in San Antonio or using San Antonio as a base while identifying replacement properties nationwide. The remote location option explicitly supports the nationwide inventory support capability.

## Property Types Taxonomy (20 property types)

Property types follow the tier catalog system with all 8 untouchables required (convenience store gas, drive-thru QSR, pharmacy, dollar store, coffee drive-thru, auto parts retail, hard discount grocer, ground lease outparcel). Core focus types (3-5 selected) include urgent care, dialysis center, veterinary clinic, auto service, tire store, tractor supply, last mile logistics, and grocery anchored outparcel. Strong additions (1-3 selected) include specialty grocer, casual dining with drive-thru, telecom wireless, parcel shipping, and fuel C store with car wash.

This selection balances rural, suburban, and urban property types suitable for 1031 exchanges, with emphasis on single tenant net lease properties that provide stable income and qualify as like-kind replacement properties. The taxonomy supports nationwide property identification by covering property types commonly available across different markets.

## Inventory Categories (7 categories)

Inventory categories align with property types and provide clear navigation paths: NNN Properties, Single Tenant Retail, Medical Office, Auto Service, Grocery Anchored, Industrial Flex, and Ground Lease. Each category routes to inventory listings matching that property type, supporting the nationwide replacement property identification mission.
